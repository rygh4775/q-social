# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Q-Social, a simple social chat application designed for a 2-hour workshop. The application allows users to post short messages and view them in a live feed. The system emphasizes simplicity with anonymous posting, basic styling, and straightforward functionality to demonstrate spec-driven development principles without overwhelming technical complexity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to post short messages, so that I can share thoughts with others in the chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the message input field THEN the system SHALL accept text up to 280 characters
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Post" button THEN the system SHALL save the message and display it in the feed
3. WHEN a message is posted THEN the system SHALL clear the input field
4. IF a user tries to post an empty message THEN the system SHALL prevent submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all messages in a feed, so that I can read what others have posted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display all messages with newest at the top
2. WHEN a new message is posted THEN the system SHALL add it to the top of the feed
3. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL show the message text and a timestamp
4. WHEN there are no messages THEN the system SHALL show "No messages yet"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple backend API, so that the frontend can store and retrieve messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a POST to /api/messages THEN the system SHALL save the message to a database
2. WHEN the API receives a GET to /api/messages THEN the system SHALL return all messages in JSON format
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create a SQLite database if it doesn't exist
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle basic errors gracefully
