# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Project scaffolding and setup
  - Create project directory structure with frontend and backend folders
  - Initialize React frontend with TypeScript using Vite (npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts)
  - Initialize Node.js backend with TypeScript and Express (npm init, install express, typescript, @types/node)
  - Set up SQLite database with simple schema for messages table
  - Configure TypeScript compilation for both frontend and backend
  - Create shared types file for Message interface used by both frontend and backend
  - Set up basic package.json scripts for development (dev, build, start)
  - Create simple README with setup instructions for workshop participants
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Build the chat application
  - Create Express backend server with CORS middleware and JSON parsing
  - Implement POST /api/messages endpoint that saves messages to SQLite database
  - Implement GET /api/messages endpoint that returns all messages ordered by newest first
  - Build React App component that manages messages state and handles API calls
  - Create MessageForm component with input field, submit button, and basic validation
  - Create MessageFeed component that displays list of messages with timestamps
  - Add basic CSS styling for clean, simple interface
  - Implement error handling for API failures and empty message validation
  - Test the complete flow: post message, see it appear in feed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Build AWS infrastructure as code
  - Initialize AWS CDK project with TypeScript (cdk init app --language typescript)
  - Create S3 bucket for static website hosting with public read access
  - Set up Lambda function to run Express backend using aws-lambda-express adapter
  - Configure API Gateway to route HTTP requests to Lambda function
  - Add CloudWatch logging for Lambda function monitoring
  - Create deployment script that builds frontend, uploads to S3, and deploys backend
  - Configure CORS settings for API Gateway to allow frontend access
  - Test deployment by accessing the live application URL
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Build end-to-end tests with Playwright
  - Install and configure Playwright for TypeScript (npm init playwright@latest)
  - Write test that opens the application and verifies the page loads correctly
  - Create test that posts a new message and verifies it appears in the feed
  - Add test for empty message validation (submit button disabled or error shown)
  - Write test that verifies multiple messages display in correct order (newest first)
  - Configure Playwright to run tests against both local development and deployed AWS environment
  - Add basic accessibility test using Playwright's built-in accessibility testing
  - Create simple test report generation and CI-ready configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
